It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.

For some writers, it isn’t getting the original words on paper that’s the challenge, but rewriting the first and second drafts. Using the random paragraph generator can be a good way to get into a rewriting routine before beginning the project. In this case, you take the random paragraph and rewrite it so it retains the same meaning, but does so in a better and more concise way. Beginning the day doing this with a random paragraph can make the rewriting of an article, short story, or chapter of a book much easier than trying to begin directly with it.
